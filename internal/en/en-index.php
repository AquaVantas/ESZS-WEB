					<span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Esports Federation of Slovenia (E-športna zveza Slovenije – ESZS) is a not-for-profit organization established in 2020. Its main goal is to promote, unify esports rules and standards in Slovenia and to establish a growing esports community. Its members have been operating and striving for the success of Slovenian esports teams and organizations for several years, who are now unified under ESZS. ESZS is also a member of the International Esports Federation (IeSF) and Global Esports Federation (GEF). It holds more than 150 members, who are actively involved within the esports industry in Slovenia.
					</span><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
					ESZS is also aware of the importance of playing video games in a healthy manner and thus ESZS advocates that players should play moderately. ESZS is also working with their partners to promote help programs that focus on moderate gaming, mental health awareness, anti-doping, anti-harassment, and for those that might need it. ESZS believes that, while esports is competitive and attracts professional players, it should also be accessible and available for everyone.
					</span><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
					As a crown organization in Slovenia, ESZS is also striving to destigmatize the stereotypical notion of a “gamer”. One of the goals is to show that esports also has benefits such as providing jobs and develop communities. Esports in Slovenia has a long way to go but we believe that with the right set of sponsors we can create an inspiring environment for everyone to enjoy and participate in esports.
					</span><span style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
					We believe that gaming and esports are for everyone.
